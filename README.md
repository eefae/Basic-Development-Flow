# Basic-Development-Flow
The purpose of this repo. is to let the new one easily start to design the board.  
Those demos are supported by the Pynq-ZU and Pynq-Z2.

### lab1 - for loop Acceleration example  
In this section, we will use Vitis-hls Vivado and the Pynq-os image. 
  
### lab2 - led controller  
This one will use Vivado and Vitis to develop FPGA.


### challenge(hide)
Create an application to encode the switches to the 4-bit leds. 

### base overlay
base overlay is the FPGA design in the Pynq-os image.
