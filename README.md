# Basic-Development-Flow
The purpose of this repo. is to let the new one easily start to design the board.  
We use the Pynq-ZU to demo those labs.

### lab1 - for loop Acceleration example  
in this section, we will use Vitis-hls Vivado and the Pynq-os image. 
  
### lab2 - led controller  
This one will use Vivado and Vitis to develop FPGA.

### base overlay
base overlay is the FPGA design in the Pynq-os image.
